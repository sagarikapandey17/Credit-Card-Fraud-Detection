# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Project Overview

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is designed to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The project uses various classification models and data preprocessing techniques to detect anomalies and predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. The project is implemented in Python and managed within an Anaconda environment for easy reproducibility and management of dependencies.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical data, and splitting the dataset.
Model Training: Utilizes machine learning classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to detect fraudulent transactions.
Evaluation Metrics: The models are evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess the performance.
Anomaly Detection: Identifying anomalous transactions that are likely to be fraudulent.
Visualization: Provides visualizations for data insights and model evaluation.
Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used for data analysis and model development.
Anaconda: Python distribution that helps with managing dependencies and environments.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data distributions and model performance.
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive coding and visualization.
